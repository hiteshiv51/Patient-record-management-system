## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Hospitals often struggle with fragmented, paper-based, or outdated patient record systems that lead to inefficiency, data loss, and delays in care.  
There is a need for a secure, digital, and easy-to-use platform that centralizes patient information.

### Objective
To develop a digital patient record management system that stores patient details, medical history, and appointments in a secure and accessible manner.

### Proposed Solution
A Node.js and Express.js backend with a MongoDB database that supports:
- Patient registration and record management  
- Doctor and appointment tracking  
- Secure and fast data access through RESTful APIs  

### Expected Outcome
A working backend prototype capable of CRUD operations on patient and doctor data, fully connected to a frontend dashboard.
